<p align="justify">T2155/T2170 Family of High Speed Dot Matrix Printers</p>
<p align="justify">At top speeds of 1,050 and 825 CPS the T2170 and   T2155 keep pace with printing environments where production of multi-part   invoices, shipping documents or bar code labels is time sensitive and critical.   Engineered for relentless production under adverse conditions, and rated at   workloads of 45,000 and 35,000 pages per month respectively, these printers are   ideal for industrial and point-of-sale applications.<br />
    <br />
  Despite the growth   of the non-impact printer market, the demand for high speed serial impact dot   matrix forms printers remains quite strong. The user of these printers today   requires much more than the low-cost output and multi-part forms handling this   technology has offered historically. This market demands that we push the   envelope on speed, provide multiple input tractors, expand functionality and   deliver superior reliability for operation in harsh environments. The T2155 and   T2170 provide a solution to these issues that is both comprehensive and   cost-effective.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <U>Superior Price/Performance in the Triple Tractor   Market</U><br />
  <br />
  The T2155 and T2170 employ a straight paper path on the front   push tractors to create flawless 24-wire impressions on 6-part (T2155) or 7-part   (T2170) forms. Optionally configured with three input tractors, the T2170 is   priced almost 50% lower than the nearest alternative. For applications where   purchase price is a major concern, the T2155 is expandable to two input tractors   and provides a powerful solution at a slightly lower speed.<br />
  <br />
  <U>Automated   Features for Unattended Operation</U><br />
  <br />
  For environments where productivity   is key, user intervention must be kept to a minimum. To this end, the T2155 and   T2170 deliver fully automated performance with auto gap adjustment which adjusts   for forms thickness, paper parking, and loading. On multiple tractor   configurations, paper input capacities can be doubled or even tripled via   auto-tractor switching. When paper runs out on one tractor, the printer   automatically switches to the next.<br />
  <br />
  In the unlikely event of a jam, an   automatic paper motion sensor not only stops printing but also retains data.   Once forms are re-loaded, printing resumes where the interruption   occurred.<br />
  <br />
  <U>FLASH controller: A Modern Convenience on a Time-Tested   Technology</U><br />
  <br />
  Equipped with a Flash ROM to enable easy upgrade of   alternative features and character sets, these printers include a broad range of   industry standard emulations, fonts and 15 bar codes.<br />
  <br />
  <U>Comprehensive   Connectivity</U><br />
  <br />
  With an extensive range of interfaces, the T2155 and   T2170 connect seamlessly to any network, midrange or mainframe. Auto-switching   serial and parallel I/O&rsquo;s are standard with optional Ethernet.</p>
